Hack兀 contains 3 levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced. Each level is specialized for a specific academy or age range. First, you must read a guide, and then solve a quiz based on that guide.

I created this project with the intention of helping people practice and read math. I developed a short guide so that people wouldn't get bored; that's why I designed it to be concise and not too long. After completing the guide, users take a multiple-choice quiz with four options. Once they finish and submit, they can see their results and some motivational phrases. The quiz takes some time.
